### How does it work
At first you need to create configuration file in JSON format that contains configuration of platforms and sources. Here is the detailed instruction for configuring: [LocoLaser Config](CONFIG.md)<br>
Example of Android config that gets strings from Google Sheets:
```json
{
    "platform" : "android",
    "source" : {
        "type" : "googlesheet",
        "column_key" : "key",
        "id" : "1KDu0_iel5qoNTKHZI0e4l3Uy52WisdfswYRy_GlFOPtY"
    },
    "locales" : ["en", "fi"],
    "delay" : 30
}
```
When configuration is created you should run LocoLaser with corresponding set of jar artifacts which supports platforms and sources from configuration.
Example of console command that starts LocoLaser:
``` Bash
java -cp "core.jar:platform-mobile.jar:source-googlesheet.jar" ru.pocketbyte.locolaser.Main "localization_config.json"
```
These artifacts can be download from [maven repository](https://bintray.com/pocketbyte/maven). But there is another simplests ways. If you use gradle you can use [LocoLaser gradle plugin](https://github.com/PocketByte/locolaser-gradle-plugin) instead. Otherwise in [LocaLaser iOS Example](https://github.com/PocketByte/locolaser-ios-example/) you can find [localize.command](https://github.com/PocketByte/locolaser-ios-example/blob/master/locloaser-example-ios/localize.command), the bash scripts that simplify work with LocoLaser on Unix based systems.

### Console arguments
You can override config properties by adding additional console arguments:
- **`--force`** or **`--f`** - Sets `force_import = true`.
- **`-cs`** - String. Override config property `conflict_strategy`.
- **`-delay`** - Long. Override config property `delay`.
